requirements first points and questions:
- It needs to be awesome!!!

?- if a student takes more than one course, do we need to have separate student ids or keep track on the students?
--> this app is for the FSWD course (optional for all the other courses --> one id for multiple courses!)
    --> track all courses with one student id

?- where do we get the data for the daily exercises from?
--> the data must be inserted with insert form (see drawing from Mario) --> only for FSWD course

?- API to door-entry system
--> At the moment just use a JSON file with id for the students (Goran provides the structure)

?- How many pages do you request as minimum for the SLPT
--> History for every date: date, technology, pair partners, github-url (they click on the date, then they see the pair room for that day); lock the exercises after 4 o'clock
--> trainerpages: sees all the pairs in a list with indicators SHOULD (green--> repo created, red--> no repo created, number of pushes for every pair + link to the repo) NICE TO HAVE --> number of exercises done for that day, NICE TO HAVE --> sorting --> + click on the card leads to the pair page details
--> Profilepage: 
--> studentspage:
--> course overview: is the trainer overview

?- How about the design (Luisa will show the dashboard screenshot)
--> Design is up to the team

?- How is progress tracking defined? --> this view is the samee for all the students as well as the trainers
--> exercises, make a score: different levels (basic, intermediate, advanced, challenge) for the exercises --> just bars (for one tech, one bar), where you see the progress, no additional information

?- How are the repositories of the students in SLPT showing up?
--> The repos will be created by the students and put there
    ?- Are we creating it? How are we identifying it?
--> the admin is doing that and he is just putting the Github account, NOT the repository!

?- Is the admin page just putting students and deleting them with there respective information (automatic / manual)
--> Admin update profiles with all information (github links, student-information and more)

?- pairroom problem (is that an overview about all the users or just the pair?)
--> pair room is a room of ONE pair and they should see the repo the exercises and the partner
--> pair room page should have an animation after you click on the "pair up" button
--> if somebody show up later there should be an option to pair him up later (AJAX Call to add them to an existing group? OPTIONAL)
--> NICE TO HAVE for the students to see in the pair room, if the repo is created

New Naming convention for the course: FSWD50-{technology}-{day}-{name}

Advice from Goran --> Make your own MVC in plain PHP, JavaScript
